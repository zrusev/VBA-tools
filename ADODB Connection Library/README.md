A small library very similar to MS System.Data.SqlClient.

It allows the development of data-driven applications.

It creates database connections with SqlConnection using ADODB provider.

It inserts and obtains data with SqlCommand using parameters and wraps the data around excel's listobject tables.

It also includes a cascading error handler which follows the error from the calling child to the wrapper class.
